üß† Build a full-stack cognitive architecture app called "Trivium".

üì¶ Backend (FastAPI)
Use Python 3.11 with FastAPI and Uvicorn.

Create the following API endpoints:

POST /process: Accepts JSON {text: string, lenses: array}. Returns multi-lens outputs.

POST /compare: Accepts JSON {text: string, lenses: array}. Returns side-by-side outputs.

POST /synthesize: Accepts JSON {text: string, lenses: array}. Returns a single blended response.

GET /observer: Returns a log of observer insights.

Implement a Lens Manager:

Supports these lenses: Ethical, Emotional, Logical, Symbolic.

Each lens has a process(text: str) method that modifies input text based on its perspective.

Add a Krishna Layer:

Observer: Logs system state and user input per session.

Light of Attention: Triggers a "pulse" insight every 9 API calls.

Preload a symbolic neuron map from a YAML file (neurons.yaml) with 72 Sovereignties. Each sovereignty includes light and shadow traits.

Use in-memory storage (dictionary) for observer logs and active neuron states for V1.

üåå Frontend (React + Tailwind)
Build a React app with the following UI:

Text input field for user prompt.

Lens selector (toggle buttons for Ethical, Emotional, Logical, Symbolic).

Submit button labeled "Reflect".

Output area:

Shows each lens output in a card view.

Includes an Observer panel that shows the latest Krishna insight.

Includes a synthesis slider to blend lens perspectives.

Theme: Full Mythic Aesthetic

Dark mode.

Glowing sovereignty orbs for each lens.

Subtle animated glyphs in the background.

Connect frontend to backend API using Axios.

üõ†Ô∏è Deployment
Serve frontend from / and backend API from /api/v1.

Use Replit‚Äôs built-in Nix environment to install Python and Node dependencies.

Install backend deps: fastapi, uvicorn, pydantic, pyyaml

Install frontend deps: react, react-dom, axios, tailwindcss

Expose the full-stack app live on Replit.

üìù Notes
Keep code modular: backend/ for FastAPI, frontend/ for React.

Add clear comments explaining key functions.

Use .env for any API keys or config (if needed).

Focus on getting a working prototype that can be refined later.

üéØ Goal
Build a fully working cognitive architecture prototype that showcases:

Multi-lens processing (Ethical, Emotional, Logical, Symbolic).

Observer commentary (Krishna Layer).

Mythic frontend UI.

API endpoints ready for developer use.
