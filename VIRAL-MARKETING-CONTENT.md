# üöÄ VIRAL MARKETING CONTENT - TRIVIUM SDK

## Twitter Launch Thread

üß† THREAD: Just launched Trivium SDK - the universal cognitive middleware that transforms ANY AI tool! 

(1/8) üéØ Problem: AI tools give you raw output, but lack cognitive perspective. What if every AI interaction could be enhanced with archetypal lenses?

(2/8) ‚ö° Solution: Trivium SDK provides 10 cognitive lenses (Ethical, Logical, Emotional, Survival, etc.) that automatically enhance ANY AI service - OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot.

(3/8) üîß Universal Middleware: One line of code enhances ALL your AI calls:
```js
initializeTrivium({ enabled: true });
// Now every OpenAI/Claude call includes cognitive analysis
```

(4/8) ‚öõÔ∏è React Integration: Built-in hooks for instant cognitive analysis:
```jsx
const { analyzeText } = useTriviumAnalysis();
// Cognitive insights in your React apps
```

(5/8) üé® VS Code Extension: Right-click any code ‚Üí instant cognitive analysis with beautiful panels. Security audits, code reviews, debugging - all through archetypal lenses.

(6/8) üì¶ Zero Dependencies: 17.8 kB package with complete TypeScript definitions. Works everywhere - Node.js, browsers, React, Express.js.

(7/8) üéØ Vision: Universal cognitive filter for every AI interaction on your system. This is Phase 1 - middleware for developers. Phase 2: OS-level cognitive enhancement.

(8/8) üöÄ Try it now:

**Title:** "Universal AI middleware with cognitive lenses - transform any AI tool"

I've been working on cognitive architecture for AI tools and just released Trivium SDK - a universal middleware that enhances ANY AI service with archetypal lenses.

**What it does:**
- Automatically intercepts OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT calls
- Applies 10 cognitive perspectives (ethical, logical, emotional, etc.)
- Zero configuration - just `npm install trivium-cognitive-sdk`

**Key features:**
- Works with any AI service
- React hooks included
- Express.js middleware
- VS Code extension for instant code analysis
- Zero dependencies, 17.8 kB

The vision is eventually having this as an OS-level cognitive filter for every AI interaction. This is Phase 1 targeting developers.

```javascript
const { initializeTrivium } = require('trivium-cognitive-sdk/middleware');
initializeTrivium({ enabled: true });

// Now ALL your AI calls are enhanced automatically
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({...});
```

Thoughts? Would love feedback from the community.

### r/reactjs  
**Title:** "New React hooks for cognitive AI analysis - useTriviumAnalysis()"

Released React integration for cognitive AI analysis. Provides hooks that apply archetypal lenses to any text through multiple perspectives.

```jsx
import { useTriviumAnalysis, TriviumAnalysisDisplay } from 'trivium-cognitive-sdk/react';

function MyComponent() {
  const { analyzeText, lastAnalysis, isAnalyzing } = useTriviumAnalysis();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => analyzeText(code, 'CODE_REVIEW')}>
        Analyze Code
      </button>
      {isAnalyzing && <div>Analyzing...</div>}
      <TriviumAnalysisDisplay analysis={lastAnalysis} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Also includes middleware that automatically enhances any AI API calls in your React app.

Zero dependencies, full TypeScript support.

npm install trivium-cognitive-sdk

### r/node
**Title:** "Express middleware for AI enhancement - automatic cognitive analysis"

Built Express.js middleware that automatically enhances any AI API calls with cognitive lenses:

```javascript
const { triviumExpressMiddleware } = require('trivium-cognitive-sdk/middleware');

app.use(triviumExpressMiddleware({ enabled: true }));

// All AI API calls through your Express app are now enhanced
app.post('/api/chat', async (req, res) => {
  const aiResponse = await callOpenAI(req.body);
  res.json(aiResponse); // Includes cognitive analysis
});
```

Works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, any AI service. Zero configuration needed.

### r/vscode
**Title:** "New extension: Cognitive code analysis with archetypal lenses"

Just published "Trivium Cognitive Lens" extension that provides instant cognitive analysis of any code.

**Features:**
- Right-click any code ‚Üí cognitive analysis
- Multiple analysis patterns (Code Review, Security Audit, Debugging)
- Beautiful analysis panels with lens-specific insights
- Works with any programming language

**Usage:**
1. Select code
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Trivium: Code Review Analysis"
3. Get comprehensive insights through multiple cognitive perspectives

Search "Trivium Cognitive Lens" in VS Code marketplace.

The analysis provides ethical, logical, emotional, and security perspectives on your code - really helpful for comprehensive code reviews.

**Title:** "Trivium SDK: Universal cognitive middleware for AI tools"
**URL:** https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/trivium-cognitive-sdk

**Text:**
I've been exploring cognitive architecture for AI interactions and built Trivium SDK - universal middleware that enhances any AI tool with archetypal lenses.

The core idea: instead of raw AI output, apply 10 cognitive perspectives (ethical, logical, emotional, survival, etc.) to every AI interaction.

Key aspects:
- Universal: Works with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, Copilot
- Zero dependencies: 17.8 kB standalone package
- Multiple integrations: React hooks, Express middleware, VS Code extension
- Automatic enhancement: One line enables cognitive analysis for all AI calls

```javascript
const { initializeTrivium } = require('trivium-cognitive-sdk/middleware');
initializeTrivium({ enabled: true });
// Now every AI interaction includes cognitive analysis
```

The long-term vision is OS-level cognitive filtering - every AI interaction on your system enhanced with archetypal perspectives. This is Phase 1 for developers.

Would love HN's thoughts on the cognitive architecture approach to AI tools.

## LinkedIn Post

üß† Excited to announce the launch of Trivium SDK - universal cognitive middleware for AI tools!

After months of research into cognitive architecture, I've built a system that transforms ANY AI interaction with archetypal lenses.

üéØ The Problem:
AI tools provide raw output without cognitive perspective. Developers need multiple viewpoints - ethical, logical, emotional, security - to make comprehensive decisions.

‚ö° The Solution:
Trivium SDK automatically enhances OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT, and any AI service with 10 archetypal lenses. Zero configuration required.

üîß For Developers:
- React hooks for cognitive analysis
- Express.js middleware for automatic enhancement  
- VS Code extension for instant code analysis
- Universal middleware for any AI service

üì¶ Technical Details:
- Zero dependencies
- 17.8 kB package size
- Complete TypeScript definitions
- Works in Node.js, browsers, React apps

üöÄ Vision:
This is Phase 1. The ultimate goal is OS-level cognitive filtering - every AI interaction on your system enhanced with archetypal perspectives.

Try it: npm install trivium-cognitive-sdk
